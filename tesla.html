              <h3>A little bit about Tesla</h3>
              <p>
Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California.</p>
              <p>
              Tesla was founded in July 2003 as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk, who contributed most of the funding in the early days, has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of their first car model, the Roadster, in 2009. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the higher volume Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Model Y crossover in 2020. The Model 3 is the world's all-time best-selling plug-in electric car, with more than 800,000 delivered through December 2020.</p>

              <h4>A look at the Tesla Logo</h4>
<p>The Tesla logo was designed by RO Studio – a design firm that has a longstanding relationship with Elon Musk. It was RO Studio that designed the logo for Musk’s other company, Space X, and after designing the Tesla logo, the firm also introduced Musk to Franz von Holzhausen, who went on to become the Chief Designer at Tesla.

Initially, the Tesla logo was made to fit inside a shield, emblem, but the company later ditched the shield and chose to just keep the “T” as their logo.

Every so often, companies come along that are bold and innovative enough to disrupt an entire industry. When Ford first manufactured the Model T, it changed the transportation industry forever. Now, Tesla is a company looking to improve the transportation industry again in just as dramatic a fashion by making electric, autonomous vehicles the go-to vehicle design of the future.

In its relatively short history, Tesla has experienced many moments of triumph and pitfalls along the way. Below, we’ll take a look at that history as well as the role that the Tesla logo has played in getting the company to where it is today.</p>


              <h5>History of Tesla</h5>
<p> Though the famous South African entrepreneur Elon Musk is now inseparable from the name “Tesla”, Musk wasn’t actually the one to first found the company.

Before Elon Musk became involved, Tesla was incorporated in July of 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The two men were inspired to start the company after GM recalled it EV1 electric cars, confident that they would be able to oversee the production of a functioning electric vehicle that would succeed where the EV1 had failed.

In 2004, Elon Musk joined Tesla as the chairman of its board of directors. Musk’s vision for the company was to start by producing a premium electric sports car that would be marketed toward wealthy, early adopters then move into producing more mainstream electric vehicles that would be geared toward the general market as soon as possible.

The first step in Tesla’s plan was the Tesla Roadster – a high-end electric sports car that Elon Musk was very involved in developing. After becoming the controlling investor of the company directly after its series A funding, Musk was afforded a lot of influence in regards to the decisions Tesla made and the path forward that the company took. Right from the start, Elon Musk made his vision for Tesla clear – to help solve the world’s energy crisis by creating high-quality, mass-market vehicles that didn’t rely on fossil fuels.

This vision, along with the design of the Tesla Roadster, earned Elon Musk the Global Green product design award in 2006 as well as the Index Award in 2007.

By 2007, though, Tesla was starting to burn through cash faster than the company could raise it and was forced to fire 10% of its workforce. When Elon Musk became the CEO of Tesla in 2008, he oversaw the firing of an additional 25% of the company’s workforce in an effort to slow down Tesla’s “burn rate” – the rate at which a not-yet-profitable company is burning through the cash that it has available.

Tesla’s burn rate got so out of control at one point that the automotive website “The Truth About Cars” launched a countdown timer called “Tesla Death Watch”, counting down how many days it would be before the company ran out of money and went bankrupt.

Through a combination of his own funds, profit from the cars that the company was selling, and various investors, though, Musk was able to save Tesla from ever running out of cash. In 2009, Tesla was given another lifeline by the Department of Energy, which loaned Tesla $465 million to continue working toward its vision of mass-market vehicles that don’t rely on fossil fuels.
         
         In 2010, Tesla took another meaningful step toward that vision by unveiling the Model S. With a price of over $72,000 the Tesla Model S was still a long way from the type of mass-market vehicles that the company was working toward. Still, it was definitely a step in the right direction given the Roadster’s $200,000 price tag.

Around the same time that Tesla unveiled the Model S, the company went public. Investors were optimistic about the future of Tesla, given the company’s lofty goals, and the stock price soared. However, a number of setbacks ranging from vehicle fires to manufacturing issues have made for a bumpy road in Tesla’s stock price, causing the company’s value to rise and fall dramatically over the years.

Today, Elon Musk and Tesla still remain committed to their vision of fossil-fuel-free transportation, working to increase the range and performance of their vehicles while also making them more affordable. In recent years, producing cars that will drive themselves has become another goal for Tesla, and the company remains profoundly committed to creating the software and hardware necessary for Tesla cars to navigate on the roads without any input from the driver.</p>

              <h6>Tesla at 2020</h6>
              
              <p>
Tesla has overhauled Japanese rival Toyota to become the world’s most valuable automotive company.

Despite never having made a profit, the billionaire Elon Musk’s electric car manufacturer has been tipped by some pundits to achieve a valuation of more than $1tn (£800bn) as demand for electric vehicles soars.

Shares in Tesla climbed by more than 4% during Wednesday to more than $1,100 apiece, giving the company a valuation of $209bn, ahead of Toyota on $205bn. The increase means Tesla has now outstripped Toyota on the stock market, even factoring in differences in the way that companies are valued in the US and Japan.

Tesla’s performance is all the more remarkable given that it has never made a profit, but analysts have pointed to the company’s prospects as a market leader in battery-powered vehicle technology.
